# Usage
``python generator.py {source-language} {target-language} {source-file}``

e.g. ``python generator.py en de sample/english.txt``

> [!NOTE]
> The sample folder contains English and Czech sentences as generated by ChatGPT so you can try it out, I recommend ChatGPT for the generation, I did not bake the API in because it's not free :(

## Currently supported langauges
English (``en``), German (``de``), Czech (``cs``)

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind Google Translate is currently used for the translation, therefore it is imperfect, I will update it with more translator options coming soon, for now Google is universal.

## Output
The script generates a ``.csv`` in format [Language1, WordContainerLang1, Language2, WordContainerLang2]. You can therefore generate ``en->de`` or ``de->en`` both ways just flipping the order. 

Generates ``export_{source_lang}_{target_lang}_{time}.csv`` in the export directory.
